> **Winter Term 2022 Simon Fraser University**

## Course Overview
The aim of this course is to introduce the fundemental mathematical tools and survey contemporary methods used to understand and forcast epidemic dynamics and their use to inform public health policy. As a rapidly changing field, this course will focus on developing our ability to understand, analyze, and apply the recent scientific literature.  

This course will consist of four modules:
* Mathematical Modelling in Epidemiology
* Disease Ecology and Evolution
* Genomic Epidmeiology
* Within-host Models
